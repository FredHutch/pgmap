# CONTRIBUTING

This document describes how to contribute to this R package.

## GitHub Workflow

- File an issue with anything you see that needs to be considered, added or fixed.
- Assign yourself to an issue that you'd like to work on. If you have any questions about how to go about the issue you've been assigned to, communicate your questions on that issue!
- Clone this repository locally and create a new branch to work on this issue from.
- When you feel you have enough to discuss, push the branch and open a pull request. When you do this, you will see a series of checks begin to run:

## Automatic checks
