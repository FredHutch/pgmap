\title{Obtain the counts for a group of samples}
\usage{
calc_counts(bam_dir, sample_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_dir}{a file path to a directory where the bam files associated with the sample names will be stored.}

\item{sample_name}{a character vector that indicates the name of the samples as they are listed in the file names.}

\description{
This function takes a forward and reverse bam files for a group of samples and returns the counts and stats.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# This will be the directory that contains all the file path
bam_dir <- file.path(example_data_folder(), "bam") 

# These MUST be names that are listed in the bam file name itself.
# There needs to be exactly 2 bam files per sample
sample_names = c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3")

counts_df <- sample_count(
  bam_dir = bam_dir 
  sample_names = sample_names
)

# We can write these to CSV files like this
readr::write_csv(counts_df$counts, "counts_pgmap.tsv")
readr::write_csv(counts_df$stats, "stats_pgmap.tsv")
