  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Pooled library CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening across
               hundreds of cell lines has identified genes whose disruption
               leads to fitness defects, a critical step in identifying
               candidate cancer targets. However, the number of essential genes
               detected from these monogenic knockout screens is low compared
               to the number of constitutively expressed genes in a cell.
               RESULTS: Through a systematic analysis of screen data in cancer
               cell lines generated by the Cancer Dependency Map, we observe
               that half of all constitutively expressed genes are never
               detected in any CRISPR screen and that these never-essentials
               are highly enriched for paralogs. We investigated functional
               buffering among approximately 400 candidate paralog pairs using
               CRISPR/enCas12a dual-gene knockout screening in three cell
               lines. We observe 24 synthetic lethal paralog pairs that have
               escaped detection by monogenic knockout screens at stringent
               thresholds. Nineteen of 24 (79\%) synthetic lethal interactions
               are present in at least two out of three cell lines and 14 of 24
               (58\%) are present in all three cell lines tested, including
               alternate subunits of stable protein complexes as well as
               functionally redundant enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these
               observations strongly suggest that functionally redundant
               paralogs represent a targetable set of genetic dependencies that
               are systematically under-represented among cell-essential genes
               in monogenic CRISPR-based loss of function screens.",

               coexpression of CRISPR-associated nucleases 9 and 12a (Cas9 and
